# TwitterSentimentAnalysisPythonAlchemy
A simple python app which uses Alchemy API to perform sentiment analysis on tweets of a particular topic and location.

You will have to edit the word to search for, location and input your own API keys to test.py file. I've included the alchemy API files simplicity and easy setup.

The graph.py file is for drawing a bargraph to compare different sentiments of tweets from different places. The final sentiment data is stored in a file called final. Take the data from there and plugin to the graph.py file.
